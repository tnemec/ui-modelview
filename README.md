# ui-modelview

## Experimental reactive Javascript front-end framework

This is an attempt to create a framework to aid development of basic single page web apps. It features event and data binding similar to frameworks like React, Angular or Vue. 

This is a work in progress and not ready for serious app development. I discovered many challenges facing reactive frameworks and would probably stick to more well known projects.
